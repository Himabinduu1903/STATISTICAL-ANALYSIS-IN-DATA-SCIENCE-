# STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS-IN-DATA-SCIENCE-


The document I provided outlines the application of statistical methods and inferential analysis using Python libraries such as SciPy, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels. Here's a summary and analysis:


1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - **Libraries Used:** SciPy and Pandas.
   - **Descriptive Metrics Calculated:**
     - **Mean, Median, Mode:** These were computed for various features in a dataset, offering insights into central tendencies.
     - **Standard Deviation and Variance:** These metrics were also calculated to provide insights into the dispersion of the data.
     - **Range, Skewness, and Kurtosis:** These additional metrics provide further insights into data distribution, showing asymmetry and peakedness.

   The document emphasizes the importance of these metrics in summarizing data, which is a foundational step in any data analysis process.

2. **Inferential Statistics**
   - **Hypothesis Testing:** A one-sample t-test was performed to test a hypothesis about the fetal health feature. The results showed a statistically significant deviation from the hypothetical population mean (T-Statistic: -1403.097, P-Value: 0.0).
   - **Confidence Intervals:** The document mentions confidence intervals, but specific intervals for features are not calculated in the provided excerpts.

   Inferential statistics help in making predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data, which is a crucial aspect of data analysis.

3. **Regression Analysis**
   - The document includes steps for performing regression analysis using Scikit-learn. It outlines how to split data into features and target variables, standardize the data, and apply logistic regression.
   - **Metrics Evaluated:** Classification reports, accuracy scores, and confusion matrices were mentioned but not detailed in the provided content.

   Regression analysis helps in understanding relationships between variables, which is essential for predictive modeling.

4. **Datasets**
   - The document uses a dataset related to fetal health, possibly from Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains various features such as baseline value, accelerations, uterine contractions, and others, which are analyzed for statistical properties.

 5. **Practical Exercises**
   - The document encourages practical exercises involving health-related datasets to apply these statistical methods. Exercises include calculating descriptive statistics and performing regression analysis, which are vital for hands-on learning.

   - 
 **Conclusion**
This document is an educational resource that guides users through applying statistical methods to datasets using Python. It provides practical examples and exercises that emphasize the importance of descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as regression analysis. It serves as a useful tutorial for those looking to deepen their understanding of statistical methods in Python.
